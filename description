INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:
In preparation and lead up to the Kenya general election this 2017, civic participation is crucial for the wider East African community for democracy to function and help distribute and redistribute economic resources, through informed voting. The U.N.S.D (United Nations Statistics Division), is the world body championing a lot of major changes in the conduct of statistics body of member states and stakeholders alike. 
The old approach of making use of traditional data sources has been challenged by the ever expansive technological growth and development as pushed by the private sectors and governments of respective member countries who are also funding bodies to major development agencies. There is a need to embrace and integrate new practices and overhaul the data collection and analysis efforts of not only the developed but also the developing countries. In realization of these realities policy approaches agreed  upon by global statistical sector stakeholders have jointly introduced 7 task teams to work on :- Access and Partnerships, Big Data and the Sustainable Development Goals, Mobile Phone Data, Satellite Imagery and Geo-Spatial Data, Social Media Data, Training, Skills and Capacity-building and Committee on Global Platform for Data, Services and Applications. This research work will not only affect how data mining and predictive analytics is approached to seek to augment it by the realities of the changing technology landscape.
Civic participation challenges and human computer interaction current realities have led to the rise of new disciplines seeking to create new solutions to enhance participation and real time situation mapping challenges with an aim of forecasting election hot spots from our daily interaction on social media and other sources of information to augment the traditional data pool. More research into solutions is ongoing but there are wide gaps preventing some key IT infrastructure sectors from moving forward within the local realities of Kenya and the wider East Africa.
PROBLEM:
There is a wide gap of applied and easily adoptable technologies  to guide the development of a slang I.e Kiswahili-English-local dialect Lexicon of negative and positive sentiment that is highly accurate in its predictive power and capabilities for sentiment analysis modeling. Not only is this missing for the more than 90 Million Swahili speaking inhabitants; natural language processing techniques that take into account the hybrid languages that come out of combination of local dialect phrases with Swahili and English words  are missing.

MY PROPOSED SOLUTIONS:

Building and Open Source enterprise level technologies that do the following:
- Apply machine learning classifiers for sorting and categorizing hate speech or inflammatory language that is likely to lead to hate crime by data mining of social media  to build a sentiment analysis tool of the issues leading up to the general elections, by tracking conversations and posts in derived Swahili-english-and other-Kenyan-native dialect, to inform civic awareness interventions and map out hot spots.
- Develop Swahili-english-and other-Kenyan-native dialect, lexicons from real live experiences that is automated in building a reinforced learning model to be used by natural language processing applications in text and sentiment analysis in the 90 million Swahili speaking East African community, with an aim of replicating it across other dialects with a reinforced machine learning model. This is because natural language in East Africa is mixed by pidgin derivations of many languages.
- Open Source and crowd source the code and building data for replication in situations that could  benefit from this research. For example : conversation bots in native tongue.
